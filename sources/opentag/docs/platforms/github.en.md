# GitHub Setup

Use this guide when `opentag setup` asks for GitHub settings.

The OpenTag CLI currently uses a **repository webhook** for GitHub. This is the smallest correct MVP path: GitHub sends issue and pull request comments to your local OpenTag process through a public tunnel, then OpenTag runs your local coding agent and posts the result back to GitHub.

When a coding agent changes files, OpenTag's default flow is:

1. Push a temporary run branch with the agent's changes.
2. Show a suggested `create_pull_request` action in the same GitHub thread.
3. Create the pull request only after you reply `apply 1`.

That keeps the user in control. The older "create a PR immediately after every run" mode still exists as an advanced option, but it is not the default setup.

GitHub App installation is the longer-term product path, but it is not the default CLI setup yet.

## What OpenTag Handles

OpenTag setup helps with the parts that can be local and safe:

- It detects the GitHub repository from your local `origin` remote when possible.
- It generates a strong webhook secret.
- It saves the local dispatcher, GitHub webhook listener, runner, and repository binding.
- It enables run branch preparation so `apply 1` can create a pull request later.
- It starts the local webhook listener with `opentag start`.

## What You Still Need To Do

GitHub cannot call `localhost` on your computer. You still need:

- A public tunnel that forwards to the local OpenTag GitHub listener.
- A GitHub repository webhook that points to that public tunnel URL.
- A GitHub token that lets OpenTag post comments and create a pull request after you reply `apply 1`.
- Git remote credentials that can push branches to the repository. OpenTag uses your local `origin` remote for the run branch.

## 1. Run Setup

Run:

```bash
opentag setup
```

Choose:

```text
GitHub
```

OpenTag asks for:

```text
GitHub repository (owner/repo)
Allow OpenTag to create pull requests immediately after runs?
Local GitHub webhook port
GitHub token for comments and pull requests
```

OpenTag generates the webhook secret for you. You do not need to make one up.

The CLI default local webhook port is `3050`. If that port is already used on your computer, choose a different one:

```bash
opentag setup --platform github --github-port 3051 --force
```

## 2. Create The GitHub Token

OpenTag uses this token to post acknowledgement, progress, and final result comments. It also uses the token to create the pull request after you reply `apply 1`.

1. Open [GitHub's token creation page](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
2. Choose **Generate new token** if GitHub asks which token type to create.
3. Use a clear name, for example `OpenTag local agent`.
4. Under **Repository access**, choose **Only select repositories** and select the repository you entered in `opentag setup`.
5. Under **Repository permissions**, set:
   - **Issues**: Read and write
   - **Pull requests**: Read and write
6. For the default `apply 1` flow, **Contents** permission is not required because the branch push uses your local git remote credentials. If you enabled the legacy immediate PR mode, also set:
   - **Contents**: Read and write
7. Click **Generate token**.
8. Copy the token immediately. GitHub only shows it once.
9. Paste it into the `GitHub token for comments and pull requests` prompt.

Do not grant webhook administration permission unless you specifically want a future workflow where OpenTag creates the webhook for you. The default setup does not need it.

## 3. Create A Public Tunnel

Start OpenTag:

```bash
opentag start
```

Then expose the GitHub listener with a tunnel, for example:

```bash
ngrok http 3050
```

OpenTag listens locally at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3050/github/webhooks
```

Your GitHub webhook payload URL should use the public tunnel host:

```text
https://<your-tunnel-host>/github/webhooks
```

## 4. Create The Repository Webhook

The official GitHub guide is [Creating repository webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks).

1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Webhooks**.
3. Click **Add webhook**.
4. Set **Payload URL** to:

```text
https://<your-tunnel-host>/github/webhooks
```

5. Set **Content type** to `application/json`.
6. Paste the webhook **Secret** that `opentag setup` printed.
7. Subscribe to these events:
   - **Issue comments**
   - **Pull request review comments**
8. Save the webhook.

After saving, GitHub shows recent deliveries for this webhook. If OpenTag does not react later, this page is the first place to check whether GitHub sent the event.

## Test

After setup, `opentag start`, and webhook creation, comment on an issue or pull request review thread:

```text
@opentag investigate this
```

Expected result:

1. GitHub delivers the comment webhook to your tunnel.
2. OpenTag creates a run.
3. Your local runner executes the coding agent.
4. OpenTag posts acknowledgement, progress, and final result comments back to the same GitHub thread.
5. If the agent changed files, OpenTag pushes a run branch and shows a `create_pull_request` action.
6. Reply `apply 1` in the thread to create the pull request.

## If It Does Not Work

Check these first:

- If OpenTag says the webhook port is already in use, rerun setup with `--github-port <free-port>` and point the tunnel at that same port.
- The tunnel is running and points to the local GitHub webhook port from `opentag start`, usually `3050`.
- The GitHub webhook Payload URL ends with `/github/webhooks`.
- The webhook content type is `application/json`.
- The webhook secret exactly matches the one saved by OpenTag.
- The webhook subscribes to **Issue comments** and **Pull request review comments**.
- The GitHub token has write access to Issues and Pull requests.
- Your local `origin` remote can push branches if you expect `apply 1` pull requests.
- `opentag start` is still running.
